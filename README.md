# DISCLAIMER!!!
This project was created by researching, learning and using other developers codes, articles, and applications documentation. This project was NOT developed from PURE ORIGINAL MIND POWER of the developer. However, some modification, features and troubleshooting (the troubleshooting made me go NUTZ) was done by the developer's PURE MIND POWER.

# Usage
After running the application, a GUI login window will pop up. There are 2 options:
- Signing in using the a pre-created account.
- Creating a new account.

If the user has an account, they can proceed with logging in, If not, users are required to create an account before to be able to login.
Clicking on the creating a new account, firstly, a GUI windows will pop up, within the windows there's 2 sections to fill "Email & Password".
"Email" must have an email format to be accepted and the password must be 6 or more characters or numbers. A message will appear in the command
line with failure or success in creating an account.

Furthermore, creating an account successfully leads to creating a profile, which ask for ("user", "fullname", "age", "email", and "ssn"
which is Social Security Number). An option will appear if the user would like to display their data?, that's the user's choice.
"Granted Login, Earned it user" - Yoda

A successful logging will ask for the user created, so the user can be able to display their profile.
